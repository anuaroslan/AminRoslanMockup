                Hello 👋  I'm Amin, a software engineer from KL, Malaysia 🇲🇾. I do freelance work as a developer under Tukang Dev.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am specialised Full Stack Development. I code in Typescript & Flutter. I prefer deploying on a Docker container than running barenaked on a VPS. I can create static sites to fully featured web-apps (mobile too). I automate unit & integration testing with Jest and E2E testing with Cypress. I have developed applications with Cloud Platforms like AWS & GCP, also a big fan of Firebase. I am also a fan of using a CMS for my project, ranging from Wordpress all the way to Netlify CMS.

                I game alot. I used to stream regularly on Twitch in 2018. I only managed to become an Affiliate on Twitch. I am not streaming games anymore as I don't see myself being comfortable turning the thing I love to do into a career. However, I still do stream sometimes nowadays, not as scheduled as before. I used to stream as long as 12 hours! That being said, I still game alot, offline. I have a Discord server. That's where I usually hangout.
            </p>

                I do enjoy drinking coffee at a cafe. I'm no connoiseur, but it's a great way for me to hangout with friends, get some work done and have meetings.
